# Smart Medication App

This project is to help track, manage, and remind users of when to take their medications.

# Description

Sometimes when you have too many medications, it can become overwhelming to track all of them and remember certain details about medications and when to take them. This apps purpose is to simplify this process. User's won't have to think about when to take their meds, when they're running low, what restrictions apply when taking certain medications, and more. This app will do all the heavy lifting for you (once it is paired with its hardware counterpart).
